**Blockchain-Based Lottery System Documentation**
**Introduction**
The Blockchain-Based Lottery System is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to create a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof platform for conducting lotteries. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures fairness in the lottery process while providing participants with a seamless experience through cryptocurrency payments and smart contracts.

**System Overview**
This system consists of the following core components:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Players log in using MetaMask to verify their blockchain identity.

2. **Ticket Purchase:**
   - Users can purchase lottery tickets using cryptocurrency.

3. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Smart contracts manage ticket purchases, pool funds, and execute winner selection.

4. **Random Number Generator (RNG):**
   - A secure and unbiased RNG is used to determine the winner.

5. **Prize Distribution:**
   - The winner’s wallet address receives the accumulated prize funds automatically.

 **Technical Details**

**Architecture**
- **Frontend:**
  - Built using React.js for an interactive and responsive user interface.
  - Integrated MetaMask wallet connection for blockchain interactions.

- **Backend:**
  - Developed using Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
  - Utilizes Web3.js for blockchain communication.

- **Blockchain Layer:**
  - Ethereum blockchain for deploying smart contracts.
  - Solidity used for writing and deploying the lottery smart contract.

**Smart Contract Logic**
- **Functions:**
  - Ticket Purchase: Ensures proper funds transfer and logs participants.
  - RNG Invocation: Fetches a random number securely from the blockchain.
  - Winner Selection: Identifies the winner based on the RNG outcome.

- **Security:**
  - Validates all transactions on-chain.
  - Protects against tampering by utilizing blockchain’s immutable nature.

**Cryptocurrency Integration**
- Accepts payments in Ether (ETH).
- Manages wallet addresses securely via MetaMask.

### **Workflow**
1. Player logs in using MetaMask.
2. Selects the desired number of tickets and pays using cryptocurrency.
3. Smart contract validates payment and adds the player to the participant list.
4. Once all participants are registered, the RNG selects a winner.
5. The prize pool is transferred to the winner’s wallet.
